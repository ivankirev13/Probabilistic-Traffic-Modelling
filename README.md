# Probabilistic-Traffic-Modelling

Summer project at Technische Universität München

This is a project done at TUM in the summer of 2022 as part of the TUM PREP program.

In many cities there are counters at a number of intersections, which count the number of vehicles passing at that location. The data is discrete, i.e for a given counter we have the number of cars that have passed within each hour. 

The objective of the first project is to create a mathematical model describing the traffic of a given counter. We are using data from an arbitrary counter in Strassbourgh during a single week in 2016. We then fit ARIMA model on a training set and create a forecast which is then compared with the true data.
